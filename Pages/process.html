        <h2>MysteryHub</h2>

      <button class="accordion">üïµÔ∏è Project Overview</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>This project was built using <strong>JavaScript, HTML, CSS</strong> for the frontend and <strong>PHP</strong> for the backend. Instead of a traditional database, we used <strong>JSON files</strong> to manage and store data in the application.</p>
        <p>The decision to use JSON files rather than a traditional database was made to focus on core web development concepts without the added complexity of database management systems. This approach allowed us to concentrate on creating a good user experience while still having reliable data storage.</p>

      <button class="accordion">üîç How the Project Works</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>Users can register and log in to access the site. Once logged in, they can play mystery games, read and interact with blog posts, and explore movie recommendations. All user actions, like posting a story, liking, commenting, or updating their profile, are handled through forms and buttons that use JavaScript on the frontend and PHP on the backend.</p>
        <p>Data is stored in JSON files, with separate files for:</p>
        <p>- User accounts and profile information<br>
           - Blog posts and comments<br>
           - User preferences and saved content</p>
        <p>Admins have access to a special page where they can manage users and blog content, ensuring the platform remains appropriate and engaging.</p>
        <p>The application implements a role-based access control system, where regular users have standard privileges while administrators have expanded capabilities for content and user management.</p>

      <button class="accordion">üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p><strong>HTML5</strong>: For structured content and semantic markup</p>
        <p><strong>CSS3</strong>: For styling and responsive design, including custom animations and transitions</p>
        <p><strong>JavaScript (Vanilla)</strong>: For client-side interactivity and dynamic content</p>
        <p><strong>PHP 7+</strong>: For server-side processing and session management</p>
        <p><strong>JSON</strong>: As a database substitute for flexible data storage and retrieval</p>
        <p><strong>File System Management</strong>: For handling user-uploaded content and profile pictures</p>
        <p><strong>Session Management</strong>: For maintaining user state across the application</p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion">üß™ Notes & Challenges</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>Since we used JSON files instead of a real database, we had to handle things like generating IDs and keeping the data consistent ourselves. This required custom implementation of:</p>
        <p>- Unique ID generation for users, blog posts, and comments<br>
           - Data integrity checks to prevent corruption or conflicts<br>
           - Custom query-like functionality for searching and filtering data</p>
        <p>We had to figure out a way to save the user's information temporally through session data, balancing security with user experience and persistent login states.</p>
        <p>Using PHP was quite difficult because getting real-time updates without full page refresh was a big learning moment for us. We implemented techniques to:</p>
        <p>- Use AJAX for data updates without page refreshes<br>
           - Structure backend responses for JSON consumption by the frontend<br>
           - Manage asynchronous updates to maintain data consistency</p>
        <p>We also had to be really intentional about how we named things and organized routes so the frontend and PHP backend could communicate smoothly. This involved:</p>
        <p>- Consistent naming conventions across files and functions<br>
           - Structured API-like endpoints for frontend-backend communication<br>
           - Thoughtful organization of files and directories</p>
        <p>Getting the file paths right was a bit tricky, especially when it came to making sure image paths were correctly linked and displayed across different pages. We solved this by:</p>
        <p>- Using both physical file paths for server operations and web-relative paths for client display<br>
           - Implementing path translation functions for consistent referencing<br>
           - Careful management of uploaded files and their associated references</p>

      <button class="accordion">‚ùó Why We Didn't Implement All Planned Features</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>We originally planned to include three mystery games, but after developing the first one, we realized how much time and detail went into designing the gameplay logic, writing the story, and handling the logic with JavaScript. For example, in our current game, we had to build a clue system where players can click different hints to guess who the murderer is. All of this required thoughtful planning and testing. Rather than rush through the others, we decided to focus on the features on our site: blogs and movies.</p>

        <p>We were able to create the slideshow to display mystery movie recommendations, but we didn't have enough time to implement the rating system and saving functionality. These features would have required additional backend logic to store ratings per user and update averages, which we weren't able to complete before the deadline.</p>
            
        <p>While we got the basic profile and blog-saving features working, we didn't have time to extend the profile functionality to include saved games or show movies a user rated. We couldn't add the option for Admins to add movies through the dashboard also. This was all due to a lack of time, as, given more time, we know exactly how we would do this.</p>
            
        <p>Overall, we focused on building core features that would make the site usable, interactive, and meet all the requirements. We prioritized getting a working blog system, game, and admin controls up and running. The main reason we couldn't add all the features we originally planned was due to time constraints and the extra logic required for each feature, along with the time needed to test and make sure everything worked properly. However, we're proud of how much we accomplished with the time we had.</p>
