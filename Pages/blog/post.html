                        In the late 1960s, a mysterious figure terrorized Northern California, murdering at least five people 
                        and taunting police with cryptic letters and ciphers. Despite one of the most intensive manhunts in 
                        history, the Zodiac Killer was never caught. More than 50 years later, the case continues to fascinate 
                        and perplex investigators and amateur sleuths alike.

                    <h2>The Confirmed Victims</h2>
                    
                    <p>
                        The Zodiac Killer's confirmed victims were young couples in secluded areas, plus a lone taxi driver. 
                        The confirmed attacks include:
                    </p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>December 20, 1968:</strong> David Faraday (17) and Betty Lou Jensen (16) were shot and killed 
                            on Lake Herman Road in Vallejo.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>July 4, 1969:</strong> Michael Mageau (19) and Darlene Ferrin (22) were shot at Blue Rock Springs 
                            Park in Vallejo. Ferrin died, but Mageau survived.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>September 27, 1969:</strong> Bryan Hartnell (20) and Cecelia Shepard (22) were stabbed at Lake 
                            Berryessa in Napa County. Hartnell survived, but Shepard died.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>October 11, 1969:</strong> Taxi driver Paul Stine (29) was shot in the Presidio Heights 
                            neighborhood of San Francisco.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h2>The Letters and Ciphers</h2>
                    
                    <p>
                        What made the Zodiac case particularly unusual was the killer's communication with the public. Between 1969 
                        and 1974, he sent numerous letters to Bay Area newspapers, including the San Francisco Chronicle, the San 
                        Francisco Examiner, and the Vallejo Times-Herald.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Many of these letters included ciphers or coded messages. The first cipher was cracked in 1969 by a high 
                        school teacher and his wife. It began with the chilling words: "I LIKE KILLING PEOPLE BECAUSE IT IS SO MUCH 
                        FUN."
                    </p>
                    
                    <blockquote>
                        "I am not afraid of the gas chamber because it will send me to paradice [sic] all the sooner because I now 
                        have enough slaves to work for me." - The Zodiac Killer
                    </blockquote>
                    
                    <p>
                        A second cipher, known as the "340 cipher" (named for its 340 characters), remained unsolved for 51 years until 
                        it was finally cracked in December 2020 by a team of amateur code-breakers.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h2>The Investigation</h2>
                    
                    <p>
                        Despite one of the largest manhunts in U.S. history, the Zodiac Killer was never caught. Over the decades, 
                        investigators have considered more than 2,500 suspects. Among the most notable were:
                    </p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Arthur Leigh Allen:</strong> A former elementary school teacher who was the prime suspect for many 
                            years. He was identified by survivor Michael Mageau in a photo lineup in 1991, 20 years after the shooting. 
                            Allen died in 1992 before he could be charged. DNA evidence later appeared to clear him.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Rick Marshall:</strong> A film projectionist who became a suspect when investigators noted similarities 
                            between his handwriting and the Zodiac letters.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Lawrence Kane:</strong> A businessman who was identified by Kathleen Johns, a woman who claimed to have 
                            been abducted by the Zodiac in 1970 (though this attack is not confirmed to be the work of the Zodiac).
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h2>The Legacy</h2>
                    
                    <p>
                        The Zodiac case has had a profound impact on American popular culture, inspiring books, movies (including David 
                        Fincher's 2007 film "Zodiac"), TV shows, and countless amateur investigations. The case remains officially open 
                        in multiple jurisdictions.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        In recent years, advances in forensic technology have offered new hope. In 2018, investigators used genetic 
                        genealogy to identify the Golden State Killer, another long-unidentified California serial killer. Similar 
                        techniques might one day identify the Zodiac.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Until then, the Zodiac remains one of America's most enduring criminal mysteries, a shadowy figure who killed 
                        at least five people, claimed to have killed many more, and then vanished, leaving behind a legacy of fear, 
                        fascination, and unanswered questions.

                                    Fascinating article! I've been interested in the Zodiac case for years. The fact that the 340 cipher was 
                                    only cracked in 2020 shows just how complex this case is. I wonder if we'll ever know the truth?

                                    I think DNA genealogy will eventually solve this case, just like it did with the Golden State Killer. 
                                    It's just a matter of time before technology catches up with these cold cases.
